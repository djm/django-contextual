##Deprecation 2014.09.16

This project will remain on Github but development is no longer active and
indeed, has not been for a considerable time (2010, circa Django 1.2).

If you wish to do similar nowadays, this is definitely not how you should go
about it. Take a look at the new TemplateResponse objects instead.
